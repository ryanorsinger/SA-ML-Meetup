      "A lighter style Zinfandel, it's also lighter in color. Aromas align more with fresh minerality than deep fruit, though there is tobacco, plum jam and some pepper on the nose. Once sipped, cranberry and pomegranate compete for the fruit side, while cedar and pepper form the spice element. It's great for sipping on the porch and shows how Zinfandel can be impressively lean, even with 14.7% alcohol.\n",

      "Silhouette is Merryvale's small-production best of barrels blend from the winery's various vineyards. The '08 is a success, showing brisk acidity and new oak and yeast flavors and a creamy texture framing ripe pineapple, pear and mineral flavors. It's an elegant wine that shouldn't be served too cold.\n",

      "This premier cru is on the cooler left bank of the Serein river, making this vintage a crisply mineral wine that's tight with zesty lemon and fine crisp acidity. The hints of yellow fruits are still to develop. The wine is structured and needs to age, so drink from 2018.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here's a concentrated and bright Barbera d'Asti Superiore with aromas of cherry, tobacco and tea leaf that are delivered in an intense and immediate manner. The wine is soft and velvety in the mouth thanks to the high extraction and despite the natural acidity.\n",
      "Predicted:  89.9022 Actual:  89 \n",

      "Young and tightly wound, this wine from the family's Olivet Lane Vineyard is reduced and generous in oak and spicy dark cherry, its aromas resplendent in rose petal. Layered and soft, it's big on complexity and plush textures, with a lengthy, caramel-and cola-laced finish.\n",

      "Everything about this Cabernet argues for cellaring. With a little Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it's enormously complex, with fruit flavors that range from blackberries and cherries to black currants. There's also a pleasant herbaceousness that suggests sweet green peas. The tannins are significant, so let it develop bottle complexity until 2016.\n",

      "Fairly round in the mouth, this has blackberry, vanilla and butter notes. It's rugged and simple, but tasty.\n",
      "Predicted:  84.5385 Actual:  84 \n",
      "\n",
      "The inviting scent and flavour of green but ripe Conference pears sloshes joyously around the palate on this fruit-foward, easy and fluid wine. With its light but fruit-driven body it just seems to have been made for a summer party and spells easy joy and fun.\n",
      "Predicted:  87.0228 Actual:  88 \n",
      "\n",
      "This small-production, nouveau-style wine was made without oak or filtering. Simple and juicy, it's festive, with effusive dried cranberry and cola spice notes that are soft and easygoing.\n",
      "Predicted:  85.3935 Actual:  88 \n",
      "\n",
      "Klopp is a mix of California and Burgundy clones, one of the producer's finest offerings every year, made in an opulent, balanced style. Lush layers of strawberry and cherry are surrounded by truffle-like dirt. The wine is concentrated in tannin and subtle oak, while anise marks the measured finish. The wine will benefit from time in the cellar through 2020.\n",
      "Predicted:  94.6598 Actual:  93 \n",
      "\n",
      "Tart red currant and red apple mingle with tangy citrus on nose and palate. Very frothy lively mousse fizzes across the palate, making it refreshing and appetizing. The citrus and tart red-fruit notes appear again on the clean dry finish, making it moreish and long.\n",
      "Predicted:  88.052 Actual:  89 \n",
      "\n",
      "With 35% new French oak, this wine is dominated by the vanilla, buttered toast and caramel of wood. Underneath all that are pineapple, lemon and pear fruit flavors.\n",
      "Predicted:  87.6205 Actual:  85 \n",
      "\n",
      "Among St. Clair's 2009 range of block Savvies, this is among the sweatiest, with pungent nettle and almost-asparagus notes on the nose. Yet on the palate, the wine is full-bodied, round and concentrated, with nectarine and honey elements punched up by bright herbal tones. Long and intense on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "Predicted:  87.6042 Actual:  89 \n",
      "\n",
      "Nicely dry, silky and delicate in structure, this has pleasant cherry and cola flavors that are brightened by acidity. It finishes with the sweetness of toasted oak. While it's not particularly complex, it does offer plenty of varietal pleasure. Drink now.\n",
      "Predicted:  87.8293 Actual:  88 \n",
      "\n",
      "This wine is tight and tannic, with a rustic hint of leathery saddle and barnyard that makes it hard to highly recommend.\n",
      "Predicted:  83.2504 Actual:  82 \n",
      "\n",
      "89-91. Barrel sample. While there is 100% new wood, the weight of fruit in this expression is sufficient to power through. It will be an impressive wine.\n",
      "Predicted:  89.9487 Actual:  90 \n",
      "\n",
      "This wine is pure apricot fruitiness, giving it acidity as well as the warmth that comes from the year. It also delivers balance and a delicious, refreshing character. The wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "Predicted:  89.2801 Actual:  92 \n",
      "\n",
      "Spicy, jammy aromas of plum and blackberry are dense yet soft. This feels syrupy and rich, almost sticky, with grabby oak and blackened flavors of berry fruits that ultimately register as nondescript. A peppery, hot finish is plump but low on detail.\n",
      "Predicted:  88.2825 Actual:  86 \n",
      "\n",
      "This wine is 29% each Mourvèdre and Syrah with the rest equal parts Cinsault, Counoise and Grenache. Aromas of vanilla, coconut and red and black fruit lead to a full-bodied, creamy palate that mixes fruit and barrel flavors. The wood influence is strong but the fruit largely stands up to it.\n",
      "Predicted:  88.2787 Actual:  90 \n",
      "\n",
      "very tannic wine, with an astringent, dry mouthfeel, but it's so rich in fruit, it's enjoyable now. Floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, plum, currant and dark chocolate flavors, edged with dusty spices. Should develop over the next six years, but if you can't wait, give it a good long decant.\n",
      "Predicted:  90.7637 Actual:  91 \n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Bull makes this wine for the owners, fermenting it in neutral oak that nonetheless yields a rich wine with buttery, toasty, spicy highlights. The light tropical (banana and papaya) fruit is nicely cloaked in butterscotch, with plenty of acidity to buoy it. It's both refreshing and compact, with a drinking window of now through 2020.\n",
      "Predicted:  89.144 Actual:  90 \n",
      "\n",
      "A bit lean in fruit, in keeping with this problem vintage. Aromas of damp earth, cigar and thyme have just a hint of blackberry. The tannins are very finely ground, and soft acidity makes for a pleasant mouthfeel, but it's thin stuff.\n",
      "Predicted:  85.419 Actual:  85 \n",
      "\n",
      "Spice, leather and oak aromas rest on top of an earthy base that doesn't suggest any particular fruit. This Garnacha-Tempranillo blend feels narrow and choppy. Flavors of savory oak, baked berries and chocolate finish dry and drawing.\n",
      "Predicted:  88.2607 Actual:  86 \n",
      "\n",
      "This special wine begins with stunning aromas of cedar, roasted meat and ripe raspberries, then adds savory notes of espresso and black olives to create a harmonious blend of fruity and savory elements. It's full bodied yet supple, with a long, fruit-filled finish. Already enjoyable, it should age well for at least 10 years.\n",
      "Predicted:  95.0625 Actual:  95 \n",
      "\n",
      "Underipe nectarine, lemon pith and a touch of freshly dried grass start off the bouquet of this Chardonnay. The medium-weight palate transitions into ripe flavors of melon and pear flesh that carry through to the slightly flabby finish.\n",
      "Predicted:  85.7839 Actual:  86 \n",
      "\n",
      "Powerfully rich wine, with jammy fruit flavors to go with its strawberry fruits. The wine is driven by its ripe fruit, the acidity coming through the sweetness to finish freshly and with some tannic, ageworthy structure.\n",
